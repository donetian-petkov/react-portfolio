# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built on React, which contains a brief introduction and a list of several frontend projects I have created. 

The site has several sections, including the mentioned projects, presented as a slider, and a Contact Form, through which people may contact me. 

Some elements have CSS Animations upon loading / rendering, which I made possible with a HOC. I set up Lazy Loading as well for the components loading on the front page.

## Installation

1. Run npm install
2. Then npm start
